					<h4>News</h4>
					<p> <b>Stop Republican Party of Virginia(RPV) Leadership is about to Disenfranchise</b>
						Thousands of Virginia MAGA Voters by cutting us out of the Primary and Convention Process by
						selecting our Candidates for Us </p>

					<button class="button" id="collapse_toggle_1"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-down"
							aria-hidden="true"></i></button>
					<div class="pos-relative">
						<div data-role="collapse" data-toggle-element="#collapse_toggle_1" data-collapsed="true">
							<p class="text-left">
								Republican Party of Virginia (RPV) has opted for a State-Wide Convention over a
								Primary
								for the method of nominating its candidate for the Governor, Lieutenant Governor and
								Attorney General positions to run against the Democrat nominees for those respective
								offices. Except in this never ending pandemic, there's a big catch, the State
								Central
								Committee (SSC) which is the governing body of RPV wants to have an "unassembled
								convention" due to the Virginia Governor's executive orders which restricts the size
								of
								groups assembling. Thus the convention would be broken into smaller parts, most
								likely
								by congressional district.



								But here's the catch, an "unassembled convention" is not in the approved RPV Party
								Plan,
								i.e. the organizational bylaws, and there is no provision to hold an "unassembled
								convention" for selecting the State-Wide candidates via this method. Thus, because
								this
								method of nominating a state-wide candidate has not been approved by the RPV Party
								Plan,
								it technically can't be done unless the Party Plan is amended. But the SSC, the RPV
								ruling body, doesn't have enough votes to pass a new amendment to this Party
								Planâ€”thus
								the catch.



								Many of us would prefer a Primary, but that doesn't even seem to be an option on the
								table anymore which really is the true solution to the above dilemma. Originally, we
								were made to believe that a convention of any sort was what RPV desired, but because
								of
								the current Virginia Governor's executive orders, an "assembled convention" cannot
								be
								convened. Thus, as of right now, as an outsider looking in, a Primary seems to be
								the
								only permissible choice, but RPV refuses to support this option because they know
								that
								MAGA voters would come out in full force for the MAGA-supporting candidates, and RPV
								is
								being run by Never-Trumper.



								https://tennesseestar.com/2021/01/24/virginia-gop-moves-forward-with-nominating-convention-amidst-chaos-and-intense-division/



								But we're now learning that there is a much more nefarious path RPV wants to go down
								which will truly be the nail in the coffin for Republican voters in Virginia if RPV
								does
								take this route.



								Not only has our November election been stolen from us by the Democrat Party, our
								own
								Never-Trumpers Republican Party of Virginia (RPV) leadership is trying to do a giant
								reach around, so that we won't have a say in the upcoming process of selecting the
								candidates that run against the Democrat nominees for Governor, Lieutenant Governor
								and
								Attorney General. Instead RPV wants only the SSC to select the candidates with a
								simple
								majority. This is OUTRAGEOUS! Rich Anderson, Chairman of RPV, says he sees "no path
								forward" for a VA Convention. And we know they don't want a primary. That means the
								72
								people on the SSC will decide the candidate for Lieutenant Governor and Attorney
								General
								in Virginia.



								https://www.virginiascope.com/the-republican-party-is-planning-to-move-forward-with-organizing-a-convention-sort-of/



								Again, more silencing of our voices, and this time it's from those that are supposed
								to
								be in our own party, but are instead working against us! It's disgusting and
								disenfranchising to Virginia Republican voters.



								And of course the fix is in for these Never-Trumpers in the RPV leadership along
								with
								the super PAC they are aligned with; they have their "golden" candidate selected
								which
								they want to run against the Democrats for Governor (and I'm sure they have
								individuals
								already annointed as their candidates for Lt. Governor and Attorney General), and
								they
								want to silence all opposition to this candidate.



								These folks obviously have no integrity or moral values. Absolutely disgusting! To
								us
								this sounds like a Democrat scheme, right?!? The ends justifying the means....



								Hear it from the chairman of RPV himself, Rich Anderson, in an interview done on the
								John Fredericks Show on the morning of 1/27/21:




								So where does this leave people like us that support MAGA candidates and a Maga
								agenda??? I think we need to flood RPV with emails opposing this move. We need to
								shine
								light on this anywhere and everywhere we can. We need to call attention to this on
								radio
								and TV and make sure that RPV leadership and the State Central Committee (SCC)
								understand that they will look like a corrupt party if they make this play. We need
								to
								be a thorn in the sides of RPV leadership and the members of the SSC. So start
								calling
								into Virginia radio shows, write OpEds into every Virginia newspaper and we will be
								amending the suggested email on the Contact RPV leadership page after Saturday's
								MAGA
								Meet Up Event from 2 - 4 pm, so you will have a new template to let these folks know
								that what they are doing is immoral, and "We the People" of Virginia won't support
								this
								kind of behavior!



								What we need to fight for is two-fold (1) we need to get the RPV executive committee
								to
								hold another meeting prior to the February 23, the deadline to notify the state of a
								party primary (2) flip at least 4 SSC members to flip and vote for a Primary over a
								Convention because of the shenanigans that go on during conventions as explained on
								The
								BLOG.

								Our "MAGA Meet-Up event" is for like-minded people who want to commiserate, share

								Richmond MAGA Meet-up - Sat, Jan 30, 2021 2:00 PM - 4:00 PM EST





								For our first meeting, we will have time to mingle and chat with fellow patriots
								that love this
								country;
								we'll work on putting a MAGA grassroots network together; we'll discuss a strategy
								to demand
								that
								the
								Republican Party of Virginia (RPV) hold a convention or primary rather than
								anointing their
								choice
								for
								candidate based on only 72 people in the entire state, the RPV ruling bodyâ€”the
								SSCâ€”choosing the
								Republican candidates without us having a voice in the selection process; and we'll
								also talk
								about
								the
								Virginia Governor, Lt. Governor and Attorney General state-wide candidate nomination
								process
								assuming
								that we are able to at least have a convention. Bottom line, you will learn how you
								can get
								involved
								in
								the process, brainstorm, and discuss strategies on how we can get Virginia back!
